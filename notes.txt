Both designs show simple percentages in different means of both national shifts and state shifts 
	according to the states chosen by the user. The percentage is taken from the two year endpoints.

Visualization #1
Uses a dropbox to all the user to choose a range of years. This allows for easy access to variating election ranges.
The percentage shifts are represented with rectangles through length. The color shows what party the shift moved towards.
The visualization is easy to interpret and not complicated. The user can get a general sense of what the shifts are.

Visualization #2
Instead of a dropbox, the user can type in the number of elections back they want to see. This allows more flexibility.
The percentage shifts are shown by color gradient: the darker the color, the bigger shift. Instead of rects, it uses
	an arrow where the direction doesn't mean anything (that's a downfall of this design).
Once again, this is a very simple design to help the user see the shift in a general sense.
